## Agenda

- This section nicely builds on each topic to give you a solid, high-level understanding of Java.
- At the end of the section, we will also run our first Java program.
- We begin the section by broadly defining what Java is.
- We will then discuss the motivation behind creating Java.
- This should help us understand why certain features that are unique to Java were introduced, and one of them is Platform Independence.
- But, before learning about it, we first need to understand what platform dependency is.
- In the process, we will also learn about what compilation is, which should be very useful for complete beginners.
- To understand platform independence, we also need to learn about interpretation as it helps achieves platform independence. So, we will also discuss about interpreters.
- Then we discuss about how Java achieves platform independence.
- We also take a look at JVM, which is kind of soul of Java platform.
- JVM is a very important topic and we also have a separate section dedicated to it.
- Java software family involves multiple platforms for developing applications for different types of devices like web servers, desktops, and mobile devies.
- Java SE is one of the platforms, and is also a core platform within the Java family.
- This course is about Java SE platform.
- So, we will install Java SE and the entire installation proces will be demonstrated step-by-step.
- Finally, we will code our first Java program and compile and execute it.
