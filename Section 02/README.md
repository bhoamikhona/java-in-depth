# Section 02: Java - A High-Level Overview

**About:** This section nicely builds on each topic to give you a solid, high-level udnerstanding of Java. At the end of the section we will also run our first Java program. We begin the section by broadly defining what Java is. We then discuss the motivation behind creating Java which should help us understand why certain features that are unique to Java were introduced, and one of the features is plaform independence. We also learn about what compilation and interpretation and how it all helps achieve platform independence. We then look at JVM which is the soul of a Java platform. We will also learn about the entire Java family and take a closer look at Java SE.

## Lessons Learned

### What is Java & Who is Using it?

- Java can be broadly defined as a <ins>general purpose</ins>, <ins>object oriented</ins>, <ins>platform independent</ins>, <ins>concurrent</ins> programming language that runs very fast.
- General purpose implies that it is not constrained to one particular domain and can be used to develop wide variety of applications.
- Java is an object-oriented programming language which helps model real-world scenarios in a more natural way.
- Java's mantra is "Write once, Run anywhere" i.e. you write a program once and you must be able to run it on any platform regardless of the operating system and architecture. This is referred to as platform independence. It is one of the key benefits of Java.
- Java supports concurrent programming, which is nothing but multi-threading. This enables programs to perform multiple activities at around the same time.
- Java is also very fast and it is almost indistinguishable from C and C++.
- These are some of the core attributes of Java and they make Java a really solid, very reliable and complete programming language.
- Java was also built on few additional principles so, let's look at them.
- Java's syntax is purposely kept similar to C and C++.
- Simplicity was one of the most important goals for Java's designers. So, in comparison C and C++, Java is easy to use.
- One example is that in C and C++, programmers directly manipulate memory to free up space, and if it is not done properly it can result in programs getting crashed.
- In contrast, Java is simple and safer as it provides automatic memory management using a feature called garbage collection. This relieves programmers from directly manipulating memory, which in turn makes programming task easier.
- Java is also secure. This is important as Java programs can be downloaded from across the network and the downloaded programs should not cause any harm to the user's computer.
- Java comes with a rich library, which includes extensive pre-defined functionality and this library is the Java API.
- This helps developers to focus on writing new logic without having to re-invent the wheel.
- Java is free to use which is great for everyone including startups and individual programmers.
- Java was initially developed to run inside embedded systems and later within web browsers in the form of Java programs called applets.
- However, it soon evolved as popular language for developing large-scale web applications, standalone desktop applications, and mobile applications.
- Java provides separate dedicated platforms just for these different types of applications.
- Java is used by companies like Google, LinkedIn, Apple, Netflix, Amazon, eBay, and more.
- It was also used by NASA for their Mars Rover project called Spirit.
- Popular Open Source Java Libraries: Apache Solr, Hadoop, Mahout.
