## Agenda

- Let's look at the agenda for this section.
- Java is an <ins>object-oriented programming language</ins> and so, we begin the section by discussing about <ins>object-oriented environment</ins> and its use in modeling real-world scenarios.
- For this we will introduce Java's two of the most fundamental object-oriented concepts called <ins>class</ins> and <ins>object</ins>.
- We'll understand this concepts conceptually and also see how they can be created in Java.
- We will next look at some absolute basic coding constructs in Java which we need to know before we start programming in Java.
- Our next few lessons will include an in-depth coverage of variables.
- A variable is a basic unit of a class and is responsible for holding data i.e. it is basically like a container.
- Now, while a variable in its very basic form can hold a single value, we often also need variables that can hold a group of values; and for that we can use an array.
- So, we next look at an array which would be our first data structure of the course.
- An array is also one of the most basic data structures any programming language supports.
- While variables help with holding a software's data, a software also needs something to encapsulate its business logic, and that's where methods come in.
- Our next few lessons will include an in-depth coverage of methods.
- Like a variable, a method is also a basic unit of a class.
- So, a software's business logic or algorithms will be part of methods.
- Finally, we will look at something called constructors which as the name implies, help in constructing something and that something would be objects.
- So, constructors help with creating objects.

## Lessons Learned

### Classes & Objects

- Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - OOP traces its roots in 1960s so, it is a very old programming paradigm.
  - It was conceived to implement large, complex projects in a simple way.
  - They help model real-world scenarios in a more natural way.
- Object - their states (attributes or properties or fields) and behavior (methods)
- `class` is like a blueprint and objects are instances of the `class`.
- Variables and methods in a `class` are considered as the members of the `class`.
- Variables (or state, or field, or attributes, or properties) hold data specific to that particular object instance of the `class`. This vary from one instance to another.
- Methods (behavior) - this is common to all instances of the `class` and they define their behavior.
- Creating a new object instance of a class using the `new` keyword.
- Initializing the state of an object instance using the dot operator.
- Invoking methods on object using the dot operator.

> [!NOTE]
>
> In a real object-oriented software, you would have tons of objects communicating with each other, and the way they do that is by invoking a method of the object and passing any necessary data as input.
