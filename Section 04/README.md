## Agenda

- Introduction to Operators:
  - Explore various operators, including:
    - Arithmetic
    - Comparison
    - Logical
    - Bitwise
    - Bit Shift
  - Operators play a crucial role in performing calculations and they are essential in software applications.
- Control Flow Statements
  - They control the flow of a program by determining which parts of the code to execute based on conditions.
  - Examples:
    - If-statements
    - Switch statements
    - For and while loops
  - Loops:
    - For and while are critical in iterating over data or executing tasks repeatedly.
      - Break statement: Exits the loop or control structure immediately.
      - Continue statement: Skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next one.
  - Control flow statements are fundamental in building business logic and are widely used in all software systems.
- Variable Scope
  - Define the scope of a variable i.e. where it is visible or accessible in a program.
  - Explore the rules and boundaries that determine a variable's usability.
- Recursion
  - Introduction to recursion as a programming technique.
  - Definition: A method where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem.
  - It leads to compact, elegant, and sometimes more readable code.
  - Ideal for problems like factorial calculation, Fibonacci sequences, or traversing hierarchical data structures.
