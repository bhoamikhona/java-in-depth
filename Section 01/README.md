## Why this course?

- A problem many software engineers are facing today is in writing good, clean and well designed code.
- Their code works correctly and perhaps efficiently too, but due to poor design, the code is not maintainable.
- That is, it is not easy to understand and if it is not easy to understand, it is not easily extendable.
- That's the maintenance problem and it can be a huge nightmare.
- By poor design, we mean not following proper design principles and best practices, and this often leads to several rounds of code refactoring or code enhancement, due to which there is loss of valuable time for the company.
- So, with every software release, instead of adding new features, a significant amount of time is spent on refactoring the badly designed code.
- To a large extent, this has to do with the way we are taught programming, and there are three limitations here.
- First limitation is that most courses are good at teaching the language fundamentals, but they are still not comprehensive enough and miss out on several important features.
- Or even if they do discuss them, they are still not in-depth enough.
- Many times the focus is on teaching the syntax of a particular feature, but why that particular feature is being taught is not clearly explained.
- So, the motivation or the purpose is being missed out here.
- The second limitation is perhaps the most important one.
- Almost always, they never teach best practices and design principles which are essential for writing high quality code.
- The third important limitation is that most of these courses do not include an instructor led project that follows professional coding conventions.
- Although concepts are demonstrated via small demo programs, but that's not enough.
- So, due to these three limitations, what we have is a sort of incomplete engineer who is pretty good at working on small to medium sized projects, but falls short when it comes to implementing large, complex features.
- This affects his or her confidence levels and also puts a lot of stress on that individual.
- This comprehensive master course aims to address the shortcomings in the current courses, and the main goal of this course is to help you become a complete Java engineer right by the end of this course, and to also help you fall in love with this incredible and robust programming language, which for over 25 years has been helping companies to solve some really complex problems.
- A complete Java engineer is someone who has a comprehensive understanding of the Java language, along with the many design principles, best pratices, and professional coding conventions for building a well-designed software.
- This course takes a holistic approach to teach Java programming.
- It covers most of the language features in a very in-depth way; everything from language basics to object oriented design to advanced topics like multi-threading, database programming, and functional style programming.
- Features like lambdas and streams are also discussed in great detail.
- It is not just syntax, but motivation behind introducing these features is also discussed, and a highlight of this course is we discuss several best practices and design principles that a good software engineer is ougth to know.
- Many designed principles outlined in the popular "Effective Java" book are also discussed, and many of them are actually demonstrated in code using our own custom examples.
- Another highlight is that it includes an instructor led project where we develop a full blown book marking web application using technologies like servlets and JSP with MySQL as the database.
- Project also follows standards like MVC and TDD, where TDD stands for Test Driven Development.
- So, these 3 are the core objectives of this course.
- Next, we use eclipse for writing our programs, and a comprehensive eclipse tutorial is also included, and it teaches you all the things that you need to know as a developer, including debugging, Java programs, and JUnit testing.
- Finally, we have a special chapter giving a solid introduction to JVM, which stands for Java Virtual Machine, and it is an incredible platform on which Java programs run.
- Most courses never discuss this topic and even if they do, they barely scratch the surface.
- Several challenging quizzes and coding exercises are included to validate what you have learned. Together, all of these will help you in becoming a complete Java engineer.
