# Section 01: Introduction

**About:** This course takes a holistic approach to teach Java programming. It covers most of the language features in a very in-depth way. Everything from language basics to object oriented design to advanced topics like multi-threading, database programming, and functional style programming. Features like lambdas and streams are discussed in great detail. It is not just syntax but, motivation behind introducing these features is also discussed, and a highlight of this course is that it discusses several best practices and design principles that a good software engineer is ought to know. Another highlight is that it includes an instructor led project where we develop a full blown book marking web application using technologies like servlets and JSP with MySQL as the database. Project also follows standards like Model-View-Control (MVC) and TDD (Test Driven Development). We will use Eclipse to wriite our programs. Finally, we have a special section which provides a solid introduction to JVM, which stands for Java Virtual Machine, and it is an incredible platform on which Java programs run.
